# Marigold: Zebrafish pose tracking made easier

Marigold is a free and open source web app for analyzing zebrafish behavior. It is being developed by Gregory Teicher (gteicher at umass dot edu) in the [Downes Laboratory](https://www.downeslab.org/) at University of Massachusetts Amherst.

Marigold is compatible with a wide range of experimental paradigms, particularly at embryonic and larval stages. As long as each region of interest only contains a single fish, it is likely that Marigold can track it.

Check out our [paper](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-025-06042-2) in BMC Bioinformatics for more info! (And please consider citing the paper if you find Marigold useful!)

Marigold is licensed under the [GNU General Public License version 3 (GPLv3)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) or later. You are currently viewing its source code on GitHub, where we also host the [web app](https://downeslab.github.io/marigold/) itself.

Currently, Marigold should be regarded as **alpha-level software.** That means it is still missing elements of the planned functionality, contains some known bugs, and is likely to also contain unknown bugs. Additionally, it may not be compatible with future versions of itself. Nevertheless, since we've found Marigold useful even in its current state and hope you will too, we've released it as-is while we continue to work on it.

## Roadmap

Our current goals for Marigold encompass the following:

- Fixing bugs (see [Issues](https://github.com/downeslab/marigold/issues) for a list of known bugs).
- Implementing remaining functionality (see [Issues](https://github.com/downeslab/marigold/issues) for a list of planned functionality).
- Streamlining the user interface.
- Improving code hygiene and documentation.
- Adding a tutorial.

Once sufficient progress has been made on these items, we plan to consider the project more or less “complete” and transition into lower key maintenance as needed.

While we don’t have plans to dramatically expand the scope of the project at this time, all are welcome to clone or fork the repository and make modifications in accordance with the project license (GNU GPLv3).

If you’re interested in contributing to the official Marigold repository, we ask you to reach out to Gerald Downes (gbdownes at umass dot edu) and Gregory Teicher (gteicher at umass dot edu) to discuss your ideas ahead of time.
